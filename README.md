# bikeshare_analytics

This is my project from an Udacity nanodegree program. This program uses data from 3 .csv files to calculate statistics (with pandas), specified by user input. 
The 3 .csv files include data about the bikeshare statistics from the respective cities.
The main program is written in Python and uses pandas to calculate the statistics.
